## Requirements üñ•Ô∏è

* **Operating System:** Windows (uses Windows API functions).
* **Cloud Sync Client (Optional):** To use cloud sync, you need the official desktop client for your cloud service installed and running (e.g., Google Drive for Desktop, Dropbox desktop app, OneDrive). Google Drive must be set to 'Mirror files' mode for best reliability.

---

## Installation & Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  * Download the .rar file from the release and extract.
2.  **Dedicated Folder:** **IMPORTANT:** Create a new, empty folder anywhere on your PC (e.g., `C:\GameSaveManager`). Place the `GameSaveBackupManager.exe` file inside this dedicated folder. The program needs its own folder to store configuration and backups correctly. It will warn you if it finds unexpected files in its directory on startup.
3.  **Run the Program:** Double-click `GameSaveBackupManager.exe`.
4.  **First Run - Cloud Setup (Optional):**
    * The program will ask if you want to set up Google Drive sync.
    * If you choose 'Yes', it will attempt to auto-detect your Google Drive path. Confirm if it's correct.
    * If not detected, or if you use another service, you can manually enter the full path to your desired cloud sync folder (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Dropbox`). See the in-program instructions (`Backup & Storage Settings` > `Cloud Sync Setup...` > `View Instructions...`) for details.
    * If you choose 'No' or cancel, cloud sync will be disabled globally, but you can set it up later via the main menu: `S. Backup & Storage Settings` > `3. Go to Cloud Sync Setup...`.
5.  **First Run - Add Game:** The program will then prompt you to add your first game. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide:
    * A name for the game profile.
    * The full path to the game's save folder.
    * The desired auto-save interval in minutes.
    * Whether to enable cloud backup for this specific game (only possible if the global cloud path is set).

## Backup Folder Structure üìÅ

* Backups are stored locally in a `Backups` subfolder within the program's directory.
* Cloud backups are stored in a `Game Save Backup Manager` folder inside your configured cloud path.
* Each game gets its own subfolder (named after the game profile).
* Individual backups are folders named using the format:
    `[Timestamp]-[YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS]-[Type]`
    * `[Timestamp]`: Unix epoch time (for chronological sorting).
    * `[YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS]`: Human-readable date and time of backup.
    * `[Type]`: `A` for Auto-Save, `M` for Manual Save.
